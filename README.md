### 🚀 Overview
402Gate brings the missing link between Web2 and Web3 — turning any HTTP request into a **pay-per-use** transaction.
No accounts, no subscriptions — just instant access after micropayment.

Built on **Solana**, it allows users and AI agents to pay per request using $402G, USDC, or SOL — verified trustlessly in seconds.
