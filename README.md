### 🚀 Overview
402Gate brings the missing link between Web2 and Web3 turning any HTTP request into a **pay-per-use** transaction.
No accounts, no subscriptions just instant access after micropayment.

Built on **Solana**, it allows users and AI agents to pay per request using $402G, USDC, or SOL verified trustlessly in seconds.

## 🔗 Official Integration
402Gate is built on top of the [x402 Protocol by Coinbase](https://github.com/coinbase/x402),
implementing the **HTTP 402 Payment Required** standard for Web3-native micropayments.
